# SQL-Fundamentals

## Background
<p align="justify">
Modern organizations often have large and complex volumes of data that need to be managed efficiently. The data is often scattered across multiple sources and requires effective integration, analysis and processing. In facing this challenge, the fundamental SQL project is the right solution. SQL projects are critical to optimizing management data, integrating data sources, facilitating analysis, and ensuring data security and compliance. By using the SQL language efficiently and effectively, organizations can manage and utilize their data to support sound decision-making and achieve desired business objectives. Through a fundamental SQL project, the main goal is to manage data in a structured and organized way so that information can be accessed, manipulated, and retrieved easily. This project involves various aspects, from creating and managing tables, relationships between tables, selecting data, arithmetic operations and filtering based on certain criteria.

## Dataset
This project uses the RakaFood dataset, which contains four tables, namely:
1. rakamin_customer
2. rakamin_customer_address
3. rakamin_merchant
4. rakamin_order

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
<p align="justify">
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in context is used to model the database structure and describe the relationship between entities. ERD allows us to visually define the entities, attributes, and relationships between the tables they represent in the database. In ERD, entities are represented by tables in the database. Each table has attributes that represent columns or fields in that table. This attribute can have different data types, such as string, integer, date, etc. The ERD also specifies the primary key, which uniquely identifies each row in the table.

<p align="justify">
Apart from entities and attributes, relationships between tables are also represented in the ERD. This relationship shows how data in one table relates to data in another. Several types of relationships are common in ERD, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. This relationship is expressed using arrows and lines connecting the relevant columns between the tables. ERD in SQL is very important in the database design stage because it helps visually describe data structures and provides guidance in building database schemas or schemas. In addition, ERD can also assist in understanding and communication between development team members and other stakeholders. By using ERD, all parties can easily understand the structure and data relations that will be implemented in the database.
